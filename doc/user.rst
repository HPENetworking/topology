Installing
==========

::

   pip install topology

Topology requires at least one **Platform Engine** which is the engine
responsible  to build the topology. By default topology just includes a debug
dummy platform only. We recommend to use the topology_docker_ engine which
can be installed with:

::

   pip install topology_docker

Further setup is required, in particular it is required to install docker and
setup your environment to run some commands as root. See the topology_docker_
documentation for more information.

Describing topologies
=====================

The Topology framework supports a custom textual format that allows to quickly
specify simple topologies that are only composed of simple nodes, ports and
links between them.

The format for the textual description of a topology is similar to Graphviz
syntax and allows to define nodes and ports with shared attributes and links
between two endpoints with shared attributes too.

.. code-block:: text

    # Nodes
    [type=switch attr1=1] sw1 sw2
    hs1

    # Ports
    [speed=1000] sw1:3 sw2:3

    # Links
    [linkattr1=20] sw1: -- sw2:
    [linkattr2=40] sw1:3 -- sw2:3

In the above example two nodes with the attributes ``type`` and ``attr1`` are
specified. Then a third node `hs1` with no particular attributes is defined.
Later, we specify some attributes (speed) for a couple of ports. In the same
way, a link between endpoints MAY have attributes.

An endpoint is a combination of a node and a port name, but the port is
optional. If the endpoint just specifies the node (``sw1:``) then the next
available numeric port is implied.

Is up to the *Platform Engine* to determine what attributes are relevant to it.
By default, the only ones interpreted by the framework is ``identifier`` which
must be an unique UUID (and if missing it will be automatically assigned) and
the ``name`` which is a human readable name used for plotting.

For a more programmatic format consider the ``metadict`` format or using the
:class:`pynml.manager.ExtendedNMLManager` directly.


.. _attribute-injection:

Logging
=======

Topology provides the ``--topology-log-dir`` ``pytest`` option that allows the
user to specify where the logging output will be stored. The shells that
extend ``PExpectShell`` will log their complete shell output there in files
whose name identifies the node producing the output along with the shell.

Injecting attributes
====================

It may be necessary to define some attributes for the nodes outside of the
topology definition. Many cases exists for this, like testing a different image
using a whole suite of tests, or to specify the IP of a machine to connect to.

These attributes can be *injected* using an *injection file*: a JSON file
that defines which attributes are to be added to which nodes in which test
topologies.

The injection file defines a list of *injection specifications*, JSON
dictionaries with the following keys:

- **files** a list of files where to look for nodes.
- **modifiers** a list of dictionaries with the following keys:

  + **nodes** a list of nodes where to look for attributes.
  + **attributes** a dictionary with the attributes and values to inject.

This is an injection file example:

.. _injection-file:

.. code-block:: json

      [
          {
              "files": ["/path/to/directory/*", "/test/test_case.py"],
              "modifiers": [
                  {
                      "nodes": ["sw1", "type=host", "sw3"],
                      "attributes": {
                          "image": "image_for_sw1_sw3_and_hosts",
                          "hardware": "hardware_for_sw1_sw3_and_hosts"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "nodes": ["sw4"],
                      "attributes": {
                          "image": "image_for_sw4"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          },
          {
              "files": ["/path/to/directory/test_case.py"],
              "modifiers": [
                  {
                      "nodes": ["sw1"],
                      "attributes": {
                          "image": "special_image_for_sw1",
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]

In order to avoid lengthy injection files, groups of files or nodes can be
defined using shorthands:


Files
+++++

The items in the *files* list are paths for  *test suites* or *SZN* files.

- **test suites** are files that match with ``test_*.py``
- **SZN files** are files that match with ``*.szn``

A complete directory can be specified too with ``/path/to/directory/*``.

Only test suites and SZN files are selected when injecting attributes.

Some examples:

- ``test_first_case.py`` and ``test_second_case.py`` can both be selected with
  ``test_*_case.py``.
- Any topology file can be selected with ``*.szn``.
- ``some_test_case.py`` will never be selected, even if it is inside a
  directory specified with ``/path/to/directory/*`` because it is neither a
  test suite nor a configuration file.


Nodes
+++++

Several nodes can be selected too:

- ``*`` will select any node; in a similar fashion ``hs*`` will select any node
  whose name begins with ``hs``.
- ``some_attribute=some_value`` will select any node that has that specific
  pair of attribute and value already defined (either if that pair was defined
  in the topology definition or by attribute injection).


Overriding attributes
+++++++++++++++++++++

An attribute that was set in the topology definition will be overriden by
another one with the same name in the injection file.

The order in which attributes are defined in the injection file matters. For
example, :ref:`in this example <injection-file>` the ``image`` attribute for
``sw1`` in ``/path/to/directory/*`` was set to ``image_for_sw1_sw3_and_hosts``
first, but after this, it was overriden to ``special_image_for_sw1`` because of
the second injection specification.

The low-level shell API
=======================

The test execution machine communicates with the topology nodes through their
*shells*. This can be done by simply sending a command to the node like this:

.. code-block:: python

    ops1('some command', shell='the_node_shell')

This kind of communication is informally known as *rapid fire*.

Usually, this kind of command execution is not done directly in the test case,
but done inside a *communication library*.

Now, rapid fire allows the user to send commands to the node without much
typing but without much fine control also. For certain situations, is necessary
to specify several other shell communication parameter besides of the command
that is to be sent. For this situations, the **low-level shell API** comes
handy.

Using the API
+++++++++++++

Each node object has one or more shells that can be used to communicate with
it. These shells are closely related to the nature of the node. For example, a
*host* node (basically, a node that represents a computer that runs Linux) has
a ``bash`` shell, because these Linux hosts come with a ``bash`` shell.

These shells are represented by a *shell object* that can be obtained directly
from the node in this way:

.. code-block:: python

    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')

The ``get_shell`` method of the nodes returns the shell object specified in its
argument. This object is the one who provides the low-level shell API to the
user.

The complete API is defined in the methods for the ``BaseShell`` class of the
``shell.py`` module included in the ``platforms`` package of ``topology``,
found in :class:`topology.platforms.shell.BaseShell`.

.. warning::

    The low-level shell API is public and intended for advanced usage. This
    means that the user will have access to certain shell attributes like the
    prompt that it should be matching. Misuse of this low-level API can make
    the high-level API (rapid fire) to get out of sync if the prompt is not
    rematched properly in the low-level API. Use with caution.

Context manager for non-default shells
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To avoid setting a non-default shell repeatedly in rapid fire calls, like in:

.. code-block:: python

    hs1('from bar import foo', shell='python')
    hs1('foo.something()', shell='python')
    hs1('foo.otherthing()', shell='python')

a *context manager* can be used. For example, this can be done for high-level
shell usage:

.. code-block:: python

    with hs1.use_shell('python') as python:
        hs1('from bar import foo')
        hs1('foo.something()')
        hs1('foo.otherthing()')

This can be done for low-level shell usage:

.. code-block:: python

    with hs1.use_shell('python') as python:
        python.send_command('from bar import foo')
        python.send_command('foo.something()')
        python.send_command('foo.otherthing()', timeout=99)
        python.get_response()

Overview of the API methods
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two main methods that provide most of the functionality in the API:

#. ``send_command``
#. ``get_response``

The first one receives the following arguments:

#. ``command``: the command to be executed in the shell, mandatory
#. ``matches``: a list of strings that are to be matched by the shell (please
   see `Some examples of send_command`_), optional, defaults to ``None``
#. ``newline``: ``True`` if the shell should add a return character after the
   command, ``False`` otherwise, optional, defaults to ``True``
#. ``timeout``: the amount of seconds to wait for the shell to return something
   that matches with the shell prompt (or with some element of ``matches`` if
   defined), optional, defaults to ``None``
#. ``connection``: the shell *connection* to use (this will be explained in
   more detail in `Using multiple shell connections`_), optional, defaults to
   ``None``

Some examples of ``send_command``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

matches
-------

This is useful for situations where the execution of a command will not return
the usual shell prompt. For example, if a command needs confirmation from the
user, this can be handled like this:

.. code-block:: python


    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')
    bash.send_command(
        'rm -i some_file', matches=['rm: remove regular file ‘some_file’?']
    )
    bash.send_command('y')

newline
-------

If you have to handle a shell that performs some action immediately when a
certain command is typed (some command that does not need a following return
key press), then this argument can be useful because no extra return will be
sent after the command:

.. code-block:: python

    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')
    bash.send_command('command that needs no following return', newline=False)

timeout
-------

Shells will usually have a default timeout value that is used always when a
command is executed. One example of such shell is the topology-provided
``PExpectShell`` that uses the ``pexpect`` package for its implementation.
When a command takes more than this default time to execute, a timeout
exception will be raised, to avoid this, you can use this argument:

.. code-block:: python

    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')
    bash.send_command('command that takes very long to return', timeout=900)

Some examples of ``get_response``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Be aware that ``send_command`` returns no output, if a command is sent to the
shell in this way, ``get_response`` is to be executed after it to get any
output that the command execution may have produced:

.. code-block:: python

    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')
    bash.send_command('echo "something")
    assert bash.get_response() == 'something'

Using multiple shell connections
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Nodes have a close relationship with their shells, as mentioned before a Linux
host will have one ``bash`` shell only, for example. Nevertheless, it may be
possible to have more than one *connection* to the mentioned shell.

The shell API provides a ``connection`` argument in its methods to allow the
user to specify the shell connection that is to be used to execute the command
in the shell.

Shells will have a *default connection*, which is the connection that is used
if ``connection`` is not specified (that means, using the default value of
``None`` for ``connection``). Of course, before using any additional connection
it must be created first. This can be done explicitly by calling the shell
``connect`` method, but is usually not necessary, by specifying a new
connection in ``send_command`` a new connection is created automatically:

.. code-block:: python

    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')

    bash.send_command('echo "connection 1", connection='1')
    bash.send_command('echo "connection 2", connection='2')

    assert bash.get_response(connection='1') == 'connection 1'
    assert bash.get_response(connection='2') == 'connection 2'

Managing the default connection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The shell objects have a ``default_connection`` attribute that returns the
default connection that is set at that moment. By assigning it to other value,
the default connection can be changed:

.. code-block:: python

    bash = hs1.get_shell('bash')

    bash.send_command('echo "connection 0")
    assert bash.get_response() == 'connection 0'

    bash.send_command('echo "connection 1", connection='1')

    assert '0' == bash.default_connection

    bash.default_connection = '1'

    # Notice how by not specifying the connection argument here, the default
    # connection is used
    assert bash.get_response() == 'connection 1'

Connecting and disconnecting multiple connections
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The API provides the following methods too:

#. ``connect``
#. ``disconnect``
#. ``is_connected``

They are quite self-explanatory, and they all receive the ``connection``
argument that specifies on which connection the method operates. Please
remember that the default connection is used if no value is set for the
``connection`` argument.

Using the topology executable
=============================

The ``topology`` executable allows to build topologies on demand and interact
with them. The ``topology`` program allows to launch a topology from a textual
description or from a test (see below). The ``topology`` program is installed
as part of the Topology framework.

.. code-block:: text

   $ topology --help
   usage: topology [-h] [-v] [--version] [--platform {}] [--non-interactive]
                   [--show-build-commands] [--plot-dir PLOT_DIR]
                   [--plot-format PLOT_FORMAT] [--nml-dir NML_DIR]
                   [--inject INJECT]
                   topology

   Network Topology Framework using NML, with support for pytest.

   positional arguments:
     topology              File with the topology description to build

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity level
     --version             show program's version number and exit
     --platform {}         Platform engine to build the topology with
     --non-interactive     Just build the topology and exit
     --show-build-commands
                           Show commands executed in nodes during build
     --plot-dir PLOT_DIR   Directory to auto-plot topologies
     --plot-format PLOT_FORMAT
                           Format for plotting topologies
     --nml-dir NML_DIR     Directory to export topologies as NML XML
     --inject INJECT       Path to an attributes injection file

You can run a topology and interact with their nodes:

.. code-block:: text

   $ cat my_topology.szn
   # +-------+                                 +-------+
   # |       |     +-------+     +-------+     |       |
   # |  hs1  <----->  sw1  <----->  sw2  <----->  hs2  |
   # |       |     +-------+     +-------+     |       |
   # +-------+                                 +-------+

   # Nodes
   [type=openvswitch name="Switch 1"] sw1
   [type=openvswitch name="Switch 2"] sw2
   [type=host name="Host 1"] hs1
   [type=host name="Host 2"] hs2

   # Links
   hs1:1 -- sw1:3
   sw1:4 -- sw2:3
   sw2:4 -- hs2:1

This topology can be run and interacted with like this:

.. code-block:: text

   $ topology --platform=docker my_topology.szn
   Starting Network Topology Framework v0.1.0
   Building topology, please wait...
   Engine nodes available for communication:
       sw1, sw2, hs1, hs2
   >>> response = hs1('uname -r', shell='bash')
   [hs1].send_command(uname -r) ::
   3.13.0-23-generic
   >>> response
   '3.13.0-23-generic'


Using with pytest
=================

The topology framework install a pytest plugin that provides, among other
things the ``topology`` fixture. This fixture is a module level fixture that
will try to find a global variable called ``TOPOLOGY`` with the textual
description of the topology. If found, it will parse it and build it with the
platform engine specified with the new pytest ``--topology-platform``
parameter.

Test will be able to interact with the topology nodes by calling
``topology.get('nodeid')`` function. When all test are done, the fixture will
unbuild the topology automatically. In other words, all tests in a module
share the same topology.

.. code-block:: python

   TOPOLOGY = """
   # +-------+                                 +-------+

       assert sw1 is not None
       assert sw2 is not None
       assert hs1 is not None

Added pytest arguments
++++++++++++++++++++++

:``--topology-platform``:
   Platform Engine to build the topology with.

:``--topology-inject``:
   Path to an attributes injection file, See the
   :ref:`Attribute Injection <attribute-injection>` section above.

:``--topology-plot-dir``:
   Directory to auto-plot topologies.
   All topologies found will be plotted to this directory automatically.

:``--topology-plot-format``:
   Format for ploting topologies (default 'svg')
   This option requires Graphviz installed.

:``--topology-nml-dir``:
   Directory to export topologies as NML XML.
   All topologies found will be exported to NML XML to this directory
   automatically.


Added pytest markers
++++++++++++++++++++

:``test_id(id)``:
   Assign a test identifier to the test.
   The test id will __always__ be added to the jUnit XML report.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: python

      from pytest import mark
      @mark.test_id(10000)
      def test_example(topology):
         ...

:``platform_incompatible(platforms, reason=None)``:
   Mark a test as incompatible with a list of platform engines.
   The test will be skipped automatically if it is attempted to be run with an
   incompatible platform. Optionally specify a reason for better reporting.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: python

      from pytest import marl
      @mark.platform_incompatible(['debug'], reason='Not ready yet')
      def test_example(topology):
         ...
