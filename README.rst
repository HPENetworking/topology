Changelog
=========

1.3.0
-----

**Changes**

- Node's/Container's hostname can now be set using the ``hostname`` attribute
  in the SZN description. OpenSwitch will always enforce the ``switch``
  hostname for all nodes of this type.
- Docker-py's will now use the server's API version, instead of the latest.
  With this it will no longer required to update the Docker daemon to run
  topology tests.
- Set ``topology`` minimal version to ``1.2.0``.

1.2.0
-----

**Changes**

- Refactored node loading logic to use ``topology.platforms.utils.NodeLoader``
  instead.

1.1.0
-----

**New**

- Added Dockerfiles for Ryu and P4.

**Changes**

- The Open vSwitch node will now check that the ``openvswitch`` kernel module
  is loaded. It is supposed to work in user space, but we discovered many race
  conditions without the kernel module.
  Check the documentation of the ``openvswitch`` node for more information.

**Fixes**

- Improved openswitch's vtysh prompt regular expression to avoid false
  positives matches.
- Fixed a bug on shell management that caused the echo of the command to be
  included in the output, and thus interpreted as failed.

1.0.0
-----

- Initial public release.
