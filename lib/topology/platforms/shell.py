"""
Regular expression to match terminal control codes.

A terminal control code is a special sequence of characters that sent by some
applications to control certain features of the terminal. It is responsibility
of the terminal application (driver) to interpret those control codes.
However, when using pexpect, the incoming buffer will still have those control
codes and will not interpret or do anything with them other than store them.
This regular expression allows to remove them as they are unneeded for the
purpose of executing commands and parsing their outputs
(unless proven otherwise).

``\\x1b``
  Match prefix that indicates the next characters are part of a terminal code
  string.
``[E|\\[]``
  Match either ``E`` or ``[``.
``(\\?)?``
  Match zero or one ``?``.
``([0-9]{1,2}``
  Match 1 or 2 numerical digits.
``(;[0-9]{1,2})?``
  Match zero or one occurences of the following pattern: ``;`` followed by 1
  or 2 numerical digits.
``)?``
  Means the pattern composed by the the last 2 parts above can be found zero or
  one times.
``[m|K|h|H|r]?``
  Match zero or one occurrences of either ``m``, ``K``, ``h``, ``H`` or ``r``.
